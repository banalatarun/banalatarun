  The word Advent means "coming" or "arrival." The focus of the entire season is the celebration 
of the birth of Jesus the Christ in his First Advent, and the anticipation of the return of Christ the 
King in his Second Advent. Thus, Advent is far more than simply marking a 2,000 year old event 
in history. It is celebrating a truth about God, the revelation of God in Christ whereby all of 
creation might be reconciled to God. That is a process in which we now participate, and the 
consummation of which we anticipate. Scripture reading for Advent will reflect this emphasis on 
the Second Advent, including themes of accountability for faithfulness at His coming, judgment 
on sin, and the hope of eternal life.</b> </summary>
<summary><b> double focus on past and future, Advent also symbolizes the spiritual journey of 
individuals and a congregation, as they affirm that Christ has come, that He is present in the 
world today, and that He will come again in power. That acknowledgment provides a basis for 
Kingdom ethics, for holy living arising from a profound sense that we live "between the times" 
and are called to be faithful stewards of what is entrusted to us as God’s people. So, as the 
church celebrates God’s inbreaking into history in the Incarnation, and anticipates a future 
consummation to that history for which "all creation is groaning awaiting its redemption," it also 
confesses its own responsibility as a people commissioned to "love the Lord your God with all 
your heart" and to "love your neighbor as yourself.

  The Spirit of Advent
</h1>
<summary><b>
  Advent is marked by a spirit of expectation, of anticipation, of preparation, of longing. There is a 
yearning for deliverance from the evils of the world, first expressed by Israelite slaves in Egypt 
as they cried out from their bitter oppression. It is the cry of those who have experienced the 
tyranny of injustice in a world under the curse of sin, and yet who have hope of deliverance by a 
God who has heard the cries of oppressed slaves and brought deliverance!
</b></summary>
<summary><b>
  It is that hope, however faint at times, and that God, however distant He sometimes seems, which 
brings to the world the anticipation of a King who will rule with truth and justice and 
righteousness over His people and in His creation. It is that hope that once anticipated, and now 
anticipates anew, the reign of an Anointed One, a Messiah, who will bring peace and justice and 
righteousness to the world. 
</b></summary>
<summary><b>
  Part of the expectation also anticipates a judgment on sin and a calling of the world to 
accountability before God. We long for God to come and set the world right! Yet, as the prophet 
Amos warned, the expectation of a coming judgment at the "Day of the Lord" may not be the day 
of light that we might want, because the penetrating light of God’s judgment on sin will shine 
just as brightly on God’s people.
<b></summary>
<summary><b>
  Because of this important truth, especially in the Eastern Orthodox Churches, the Season of 
Advent has been a time of fasting and penitence for sins similar to the Season of Lent. However, 
a different emphasis for the season of Advent has gradually unfolded in much of the rest of the 
church. The season of Advent has come to be celebrated more in terms of expectation or 
anticipation. Yet, the anticipation of the Coming of the Messiah throughout the Old Testament 
and Judaism was not in connection with remembrance of sins. Rather, it was in the context of 
oppression and injustice, the longing for redemption, not from personal guilt and sin but from the 
systemic evil of the world expressed in evil empires and tyrants. It is in that sense that all 
creation groans for its redemption as we witness the evil that so dominates our world (
</b></summary>
<summary><b>
  Of course, there is the problem of longing for vindication from an evil world when we are 
contributors to that evil. This is the power of the images of Amos when he warns about longing 
for the "Day of the Lord" that will really be a day of darkness (Amos 5:18-20). Still, even with 
Amos’ warning the time of Advent is one of expectation and anticipation, a longing for God's 
actions to restore all things and vindicate the righteous. This is why during Advent we as 
Christians also anticipate the Second Coming as a twin theme of the season. So, while some 
church traditions focus on penitence during Advent, and there remains a place for that, the spirit 
of that expectation from the Old Testament is better captured with a joyous sense of expectancy. 
Rather than a time of mourning and fasting, Advent is celebrated as a time of joy and happiness 
as we await the coming of the King. 

</b></summary>
<summary><b>
  There will be time enough during the rest of the journey through the Church Year to remember 
our sins. It begins in Epiphany when we hear about the brotherhood of the Kingdom, and realize 
our failure to affect it. Then as we move toward and through Lent we realize that the coming of 
Jesus served more to lay bare our own sin than it did to vindicate our righteousness. There will 
be time to shed Peter's bitter tears as we realize that what started with such possibility and 
expectation has apparently ended in such failure. 
</b></summary>
<summary><b>
  It is only as we experience that full cycle, beginning with unbridled joy in Advent that slowly 
fades into the realization of what we have done with and to the Christ, that the awful reality of 
Good Friday can have its full impact. And in that realization we can finally be ready to hear the 
Good News on Resurrection Sunday! That is the journey that the disciples took. And so there is 
value in taking the same journey beginning with the anticipation and joy of Advent! 
So, we celebrate with gladness the great promise in the Advent, yet knowing that there is also a 
somber tone as the theme of threat is added to the theme of promise. This is reflected in some of 
the Scripture readings for Advent, in which there is a strong prophetic tone of accountability and 
judgment on sin. But this is also faithful to the role of the Coming King who comes to rule, save, 
and judge the world.
</b></summary>
<summary><b>
  Because of the dual themes of threat and promise, Advent is a time of preparation that is marked 
by prayer. While Lent is characterized by fasting and a spirit of penitence, Advent’s prayers are 
prayers of humble devotion and commitment, prayers of submission, prayers for deliverance, 
prayers from those walking in darkness who are awaiting and anticipating a great light (Isa 9)! 
The spirit of Advent is expressed well in the parable of the bridesmaids who are anxiously 
awaiting the coming of the Bridegroom (Matt 25:1-13). There is profound joy at the 
Bridegroom’s expected coming. And yet a warning of the need for preparation echoes through 
the parable. But even then, the prayer of Advent is still: 
                               Come, O Come, Emmanuel, 
                                And ransom captive Israel!

  The Colors of Advent
</h1>
<summary><b>
  Historically, the primary sanctuary color of Advent is Purple. This is the color of penitence and 
  fasting as well as the color of royalty to welcome the Advent of the King. Purple is still used in 
  some traditions (for example Roman Catholic). The purple of Advent is also the color of 
  suffering used during Lent and Holy Week. This points to an important connection between 
  Jesus’ birth and death. The nativity, the Incarnation, cannot be separated from the crucifixion. 
  The purpose of Jesus’ coming into the world, of the "Word made flesh" and dwelling among us, 
  is to reveal God and His grace to the world through Jesus’ life and teaching, but also through his 
  suffering, death, and resurrection. To reflect this emphasis, originally Advent was a time of 
  penitence and fasting, much as the Season of Lent and so shared the color of Lent. 
  In the four weeks of Advent the third Sunday came to be a time of rejoicing that the fasting was 
  almost over (in some traditions it is called Gaudete Sunday, from the Latin word for "rejoice"). 
  The shift from the purple of the Season to pink or rose for the third Sunday Advent candles 
  reflected this lessening emphasis on penitence as attention turned more to celebration of the 
  season. 
  In recent times, however, Advent has undergone a shift in emphasis, reflected in a change of 
  colors used in many churches. Except in the Eastern churches, the penitential aspect of the 
  Season has been almost totally replaced by an emphasis on hope and anticipation. 
  This does not eliminate any sense of penitence from the Season. With the focus on the Advent or 
  Coming of Jesus, especially in anticipating His Second Advent, there remains a need for 
  preparation for that coming. Most liturgical churches incorporate confessional prayers into the 
  services of Advent that relate to a sense of unworthiness as we anticipate His Coming. It is 
  appropriate even in more traditional services of worship to incorporate confessional prayers as 
  part of the anticipation and preparation of the Season. 
  With the shift to blue for Advent in most non-Catholic churches, some churches retain pink 
  among the Advent colors, but use it on the Fourth Sunday of Advent. It still remains associated 
  with Joy, but is sometimes used as the climax of the Advent Season on the last Sunday before 
  Christmas. 
  Red and Green are more secular colors of Christmas. They derive from older European practices 
  of using evergreens and holly to symbolize ongoing life and hope that Christ’s birth brings into a 
  cold world. Although red and green are often used as part of the church decorations (see below), 
  they are never used as liturgical colors during Advent since those colors have other uses in other 
  parts of the church year.

  Evergreens and the Advent Wreath
</h1>
<summary><b>
  The beginning of Advent is a time for the hanging of the green, decoration of the church with 
evergreen wreaths, boughs, or trees that help to symbolize the new and everlasting life brought 
through Jesus the Christ. Some churches have a special weekday service, or the first Sunday 
evening of Advent, or even the first Sunday morning of Advent, in which the church is decorated 
and the Advent wreath put in place. This service is most often primarily of music, especially 
choir and hand bells, and Scripture reading, along with an explanation of the various symbols as 
they are placed in the sanctuary.
</b></summary>
<h1 style="color: rgb(3, 5, 0);">
  The Advent wreath
</h1>
<summary><b>
  h is an increasingly popular symbol of the beginning of the Church year in 
many churches as well as homes. It is a circular evergreen wreath (real or artificial) with five 
candles, four around the wreath and one in the center. Since the wreath is symbolic and a vehicle 
to tell the Christmas story, there are various ways to understand the symbolism. The exact 
meaning given to the various aspects of the wreath is not as important as the story to which it 
invites us to listen, and participate. 
The circle of the wreath reminds us of God Himself, His eternity and endless mercy, which has 
no beginning or end. The green of the wreath speaks of the hope that we have in God, the hope 
of newness, of renewal, of eternal life. Candles symbolize the light of God coming into the 
world through the birth of His son. The four outer candles represent the period of waiting 
during the four Sundays of Advent, which themselves symbolize the four centuries of waiting 
between the prophet Malachi and the birth of Christ. 
The light of the candles itself becomes an important symbol of the season. The light reminds us 
that Jesus is the light of the world that comes into the darkness of our lives to bring newness, life, 
and hope. It also reminds us that we are called to be a light to the world as we reflect the light of 
God's grace to others (Isa 42:6). The progression in the lighting of the candles symbolizes the 
various aspects of our waiting experience. As the candles are lighted over the four week period, 
it also symbolizes the darkness of fear and hopelessness receding and the shadows of sin falling 
away as more and more light is shed into the world. The flame of each new candle reminds the 
worshippers that something is happening, and that more is yet to come. Finally, the light that has 
come into the world is plainly visible as the Christ candle is lighted at Christmas, and 
worshippers rejoice over the fact that the hope and promise of long ago have been realized. 
The first candle is traditionally the candle of Expectation or Hope (or in some traditions, 
Prophecy). This draws attention to the anticipation of the coming of an Anointed One, a Messiah, 
that weaves its way like a golden thread through Old Testament history. As God’s people were 
abused by power hungry kings, led astray by self-centered prophets, and lulled into apathy by 
half-hearted religious leaders, there arose a longing among some for God to raise up a new king 
who could show them how to be God’s people. They yearned for a return of God’s dynamic 
presence in their midst. 
And so, God revealed to some of the prophets that indeed He would not leave His people without 
a true Shepherd. While they expected a new earthly king, their expectations fell far short of 
God’s revelation of Himself in Christ. And yet, the world is not yet fully redeemed. So, we again 
with expectation, with hope, await God’s new work in history, the second Advent, in which He 
will again reveal Himself to the world. And we understand in a profound sense that the best, the 
highest of our expectations will fall far short of what our Lord’s Second Advent will reveal! 
The remaining three candles of Advent may be associated with different aspects of the Advent 
story in different churches, or even in different years. Usually they are organized around 
characters or themes as a way to unfold the story and direct attention to the celebrations and 
worship in the season. So, the sequence for the remaining three Sundays might be Bethlehem, 
Shepherds, Angels. Or Love, Joy, Peace. Or John the Baptist, Mary, the Magi. Or the 
Annunciation, Proclamation, Fulfillment. Whatever sequence is used, the Scripture readings, 
prayers, lighting of the candles, the participation of worshipers in the service, all are geared to 
unfolding the story of redemption through God’s grace in the Incarnation. 
The third candle, usually for the Third Sunday of Advent, symbolizes Joy at the soon Advent of 
the Christ. It marks a shift from the more solemn tone of the first two Sundays of Advent that 
focus on Preparation and Hope, to a more joyous atmosphere of anticipation and expectancy. 
Sometimes the colors of the sanctuary and vestments are also changed to Rose for this Sunday. 
As noted above, in some churches the pink Advent candle is used on the fourth Sunday to mark 
the joy at the impending Nativity of Jesus. 
Whatever sequence is adopted for these Sundays, the theme of Joy can still be the focus for the 
pink candle. For example, when using the third Sunday to commemorate the visit of the Magi the 
focus can be on the Joy of worshipping the new found King. Or the Shepherds as the symbol for 
the third Sunday brings to mind the joy of the proclamation made to them in the fields, and the 
adoration expressed as they knelt before the Child at the manger. If used on the fourth Sunday of 
Advent, it can symbolize the Joy in fulfilled hope.

  Small Things and Possibility: An Advent Reflection
</h1>
<summary><b>
  We live in a world in which bigger and better define our expectations for much of life. We have 
become so enamored by super size, super stars, and high definition that we tend to view life 
through a lens that so magnifies what we expect out of the world that we tend not to see potential 
in small things. But as the prophet Zechariah reminds us (Zech 4:10), we should not "despise the 
day of small things," because God does some of his best work with small beginnings and 
impossible situations. 
It is truly a humbling experience to read back through the Old Testament and see how frail and 
imperfect all the "heroes" actually are. Abraham, the coward who cannot believe the promise. 
Jacob, the cheat who struggles with everybody. Joseph, the immature and arrogant teen. Moses, 
the impatient murderer who cannot wait for God. Gideon, the cowardly Baal-worshipper. 
Samson, the womanizing drunk. David, the power abusing adulterer. Solomon, the unwise wise 
man. Hezekiah, the reforming king who could not quite go far enough. And finally, a very young 
Jewish girl from a small village in a remote corner of a great empire. 
It never ceases to amaze me that God often begins with small things and inadequate people. It 
certainly seems that God could have chosen "bigger" things and "better" people to do His work 
in the world. Yet if God can use them, and reveal Himself through them in such marvelous ways, 
it means that He might be able to use me, inadequate, and unwise, and too often lacking in faith 
that I am. And it means that I need to be careful that I do not in my own self-righteousness put 
limits on what God can do with the smallest things, the most unlikely of people, in the most 
hopeless of circumstances. I think that is part of the wonder of the Advent Season. 
I am convinced that one of the main purposes of the incarnation of Jesus was to provide hope. 
While most people today want to talk about the death of Jesus and the Atonement of sins, the 
early Church celebrated the Resurrection and the hope it embodied. It was a proclamation of a 
truth that rang throughout the Old Testament, that endings are not always endings but are 
opportunities for God to bring new beginnings. The Resurrection proclaimed that truth even 
about humanity’s greatest fear, death itself. 
Both the season of Advent and the season of Lent are about hope. It is not just hope for a better 
day or hope for the lessening of pain and suffering, although that is certainly a significant part of 
it. It is more about hope that human existence has meaning and possibility beyond our present 
experiences, a hope that the limits of our lives are not nearly as narrow as we experience them to 
be. It is not that we have possibility in ourselves, but that God is a God of new things and so all 
things are possible
God's people in the first century wanted Him to come and change their oppressive circumstances, 
and were angry when those immediate circumstances did not change. But that is a short sighted 
view of the nature of hope. Our hope cannot be in circumstances, no matter how badly we want 
them or how important they are to us. The reality of human existence, with which the Book of 
Job struggles, is that God's people experience that physical existence in the same way that others 
do. Christians get sick and die, Christians are victims of violent crimes, and Christians are hurt 
and killed in traffic accidents, bombings, war, and in some parts of the world, famine If our hope 
is only in our circumstances, as we define them to be good or as we want them to be to make us 
happy, we will always be disappointed. That is why we hope, not in circumstances, but in God. 
He has continually, over the span of four thousand years, revealed himself to be a God of 
newness, of possibility, of redemption, the recovery or transformation of possibility from 
endings that goes beyond what we can think or even imagine (Eph 3:20). The best example of 
that is the crucifixion itself, followed by the resurrection. That shadow of the cross falls even 
over the manger. 
Yet, it all begins in the hope that God will come and come again into our world to reveal himself 
as a God of newness, of possibility, a God of new things. This time of year we contemplate that 
hope embodied, enfleshed, incarnated, in a newborn baby, the perfect example of newness, 
potential, and possibility. During Advent, we groan and long for that newness with the hope, the 
expectation, indeed the faith, that God will once again be faithful to see our circumstances, to 
hear our cries, to know our longings for a better world and a whole life (Ex 3:7). And we hope 
that as he first came as an infant, so he will come again as King! 
My experience tells me that those who have suffered and still hope understand far more about 
God and about life than those who have not. Maybe that is what hope is about: a way to live, not 
just to survive, but to live authentically amidst all the problems of life with a Faith that continues 
to see possibility when there is no present evidence of it, just because God is God. That is also 
the wonder of Advent.

  True to form, the finale gave us an ending that was really a beginning. Adventure Time has always emphasized a Buddhist-style philosophy of endless renewal; death leads to rebirth, chaos to order, to chaos again, again, and again.</b>
